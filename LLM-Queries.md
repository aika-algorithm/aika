# Cleanup
Hi, I’m currently in the process of setting up a C++ software project and would like to do that by only providing a structured textual description of the project. The goal is that this description is complete enough so that you can implement the actual classes yourself. In the first step I want you to read through this description and tell me what is missing or unclear. Where you need more information. You can also reorganize the description for more clarity. Also, the current description of the project is not nearly complete. I just want to see if I’m going in the right direction. Please don’t generate any code yet.
